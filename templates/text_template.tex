\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Begin by stating your topic and thesis clearly. For example: \textit{In this paper, I will argue that knowledge is not justified true belief.} It is also standard to outline the structure of your paper: \textit{First, I will present Gettier's original counterexamples. Second, I will... Finally, I will conclude that...}

\section{Exposition and Argument}
\label{sec:argument}

Always fairly explain the view you are engaging with before critiquing it.

\begin{argument}
    This is a block quote or a reconstruction of another philosopher's argument. You can use this environment to set it apart visually from your own prose. For example, you might summarize Descartes' Cogito argument here.
\end{argument}

You can number premises of an argument clearly using the \texttt{enumerate} environment:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)] % This creates (1), (2) style numbering
    \item \label{premise:1} All men are mortal.
    \item \label{premise:2} Socrates is a man.
    \item[\therefore] \label{conclusion} Socrates is mortal. % \therefore gives the therefore symbol
\end{enumerate}

As you can see from premises \ref{premise:1} and \ref{premise:2}, the conclusion \ref{conclusion} follows necessarily.

\section{Critical Discussion}
\label{sec:critical}

This is where you present your original contributionâ€”your critique, analysis, or positive view.

\begin{objection}
    However, one might object that the first premise is false. What if genetic engineering allows some humans to become immortal? This would undermine the entire argument.
\end{objection}

\begin{reply}
    In reply to this objection, we can modify the first premise to be \textit{All biologically natural men are mortal}. This accommodates the objector's point without surrendering the argument's validity.
\end{reply}

You can also use footnotes for tangential but interesting points.\footnote{This is a great place to mention an interesting aside, a further reference, or a complicating point that would break the flow of the main argument.}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Briefly summarize the path your paper has taken and restate your conclusion. Avoid introducing new arguments or evidence here.
